> Using proper pseudo-code, describe the following primitive algorithms:


* Making coffee;

A:
FUNCTION makeCoffee
 IF coffee filter is FALSE
  ADD FILTER
 ELSE add coffee grounds to filter
  UNTIL desired amount has been met
 END IF
  TURN ON coffee machine
 WHILE coffee is not brewed
  keep brewing
 END WHILE
END FUNCTION

* Washing dishes;

A:

FUNCTION washDishes
GET soap
GET sponge
INIT soapySponge
SET isTapOn = true
WHILE (plates != 0)
	USE soapySponge to wash plate
END WHILE
SET isTapOn = false
END FUNCTION

* A choice of your own.

A:
FUNCTION brushTeeth
GET toothbrush
GET toothpaste
SET toothbrushReady = toothbrush + toothpaste
SET timer to 2 minutes
WHILE (timer > 0)
	USE toothbrushReady to Brush teeth
END WHILE
ClEAN toothbrushReady
END FUNCTION


> As with the knot algorithm, there may be more than one way to solve the problem. It is essential to try to pick the best algorithm for a situation. Name three companies who created an algorithm that made them successful, e.g., Google's search algorithm. It doesn't need to be a tech example (such as a recipe or manufacturing a product). Google's algorithm produces more relevant results than other search engines; what about each of your cases make them stand out?

A:
* Netflix - uses an algorithm to suggest new shows to its subscribers based on what they have watched in the past
* Facebook - uses an algorithm to help target ads to people of a certain demographic, and user activity
* Match.com - uses an algorithm to suggest possible matches based on preferences and activity

> Hypothesize about what constitutes an efficient algorithm versus an inefficient algorithm.

A: To make an Algorithm effective I would think it would need to produce the best results, with the least amount of resources, in the shortest amount of time. Opposed to an inefficient algorithm that may take longer, use more resources or not produce as good of results
